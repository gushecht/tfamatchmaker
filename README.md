# Track & Field Athlete Matchmaker

When high schoolers start thinking about applying to colleges, there are so many options that it can be hard to know where to start.

For high schoolers who are track and field athletes, the Track & Field Athlete Matchmaker can make the college search easier.

The T&F Althete Matchmaker takes in a high school track and field athlete's best performance for a specified event and returns a list of the top colleges to which they should consider applying based on the event and their performance.

Behind the scenes is a database of walkon standards and best performances for schools across the country.  When a student submits their best performance, they get back their top five matches.  Schools are ranked first by how hard their walkon is and then by how good their best performance is.  In other words, the hardest team to get onto with the best performance for a given event will be at the top.

Unfortunately, the data that drives the T&F Athlete Matchmaker is proprietary and can't be made available for demo purposes.
